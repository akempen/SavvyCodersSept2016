            <h3>Italy</h3>
            <p>I LOVE to travel. I first traveled to Europe after my senior year in high school and I've had the travel bug ever since. I've been to Europe several times, including studying abroad in Italy, but this November my husband and I are mixing things up and going to South Africa. It's going to be so different and I can't wait!
